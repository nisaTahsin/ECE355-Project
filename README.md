# ECE355-Project

This is the embedded programming project for the Microprocessor-Based Systems course. The files are seperated into two for meeting test requirements, and are not dependant on each other. ADC + DAC prints the resistance in the circuit, hardcoded for a max of 5k Ohm resistance. LED allows an incrementing counter to be displayed on an OLED screen, which switches between two modes when the user button is pressed
